**Counter** is a little different.

It is built with the following design goals in mind:

- A modular, minimal, clean interface.
- A function-over-form design that keeps you in the game and spending less time fiddling around.
- A “perfect” Commander damage solution:
  - Easy to use — just draw/drag a line to who you’re attacking. That’s it.
  - Supports Partners with no extra effort, Infect commanders, and self-damage.
  - A clear interface that always has your commmander damage on display.
  - Even supports 8 player commander, for those 24hr gaming sessions :)
- Free (on Android),  tiny - under 4mb download, and the source will be available on GitHub.
- Zero backend server requirements. No API nonsense — it’s a life counter; you don’t need that.
- Future-proof design. A new mechanic you need to track comes out tomorrow? Already supported. You can create any floating labels or counters you like — it even supports emoji to track colored mana.
- Fully customizable. Per-player editing lets you size, rotate, and move the counter stack. Your device, your layout.
- Full autosaving. Accidentally close the app? No problem — it remembers.
- Different settings for different playgroups? No problem — a full user profile solution with importing and exporting your settings.
- Dedicated reset menu. Reset only what you want and pick the starting player automatically!
- A fully featured dice and coin menu, letting you roll multiple dice or coins at once.
- Full turn timer and game timer solution, with override admin controls in case anyone makes a mistake.
  - Turn timer: Count up, Count down, Per Game, Per Turn, Custom turn ordering.
  - You can even link your turn timer and game timer together for improved ease of use.
- And now my favourite feature: **Proximity Wake Mode**.  
  - Scared of OLED burn-in?  
  - Don’t want your screen on all the time?  
  - Want to save battery?  
  - Don’t want people touching your device?  

  In a bright enough room, simply wave your hand over the top of the device and it will wake before you even touch it.

## Tips

- Hold `+` or `–` for rapid +10 input. Works for both counters and life totals.
- Need to quickly pause your turn timer? Hold your finger on the timer to pause it. If your timers are linked, you can just tap the game timer to pause both instead.
- Need to switch between Day and Night? Use the floating label: `Day        Night` and drag it to either screen edge to switch between them (hiding the inactive mode off-screen).
- Want to pass the Monarch around? Create a floating label and move it. Easy.
